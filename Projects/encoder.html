  <h1>Custom Optical Encoder for Bond Pad Inspection</h1>

  <p>
    As part of my work in the optoelectronics group at Collins Aerospace, I developed a custom optical encoder system to estimate RTV (Room-Temperature Vulcanizing) adhesive volume in our bonded assemblies. The encoder was used to track the rotation of an air bearing spindle while a live camera feed recorded the bond interface in real-time. By correlating the angular position with image-derived thickness measurements, we calculated RTV distribution across the circumference of optical components.
  </p>

  <h2>Designing the Encoder System</h2>
  <p>
    I designed and prototyped a fully custom encoder setup using IR reflective sensors (TCRT5000), Arduino-based signal processing, and a printed tape with alternating line pairs. These were mounted to the edge of the spindle, enabling reliable detection of rotational motion. To achieve directional awareness and fine resolution (~0.2°), I placed the two sensors in quadrature — phase-shifted to detect the direction and rate of rotation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mechanical contributions included designing a custom sensor holder, precisely aligning the reflective tape around the spindle, and experimenting with different sensor spacing and tape resolutions to optimize accuracy. I iterated the design on a breadboard, testing multiple configurations before finalizing the setup.

  <h2>Testing and Signal Processing</h2>
  <p>
    I tested the encoder using a benchtop motion stage that incrementally rotated the reflective surface while monitoring sensor output on a serial monitor and MATLAB plots. The processed signal was passed through a simple QAM-based decoder to resolve position data, which we validated against known step sizes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final setup was integrated with a live camera feed during RTV bond inspections, where it successfully correlated rotation angle to bond thickness, enabling volumetric RTV estimation.
