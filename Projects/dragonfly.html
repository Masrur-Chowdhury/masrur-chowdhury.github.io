  <h1>NASA Dragonfly Mission</h1>

  <p>
    During my time at Collins Aerospace, I contributed to the development and environmental qualification of optoelectronic hardware destined for NASA’s Dragonfly mission — a rotorcraft lander set to explore Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. I was part of the engineering effort to ensure critical optical systems would survive and operate reliably in extreme spaceflight conditions.

  <h2>Thermal Cycling & Optical Stability Testing</h2>
  <p>
    One of my key responsibilities was validating the mechanical and optical stability of components under thermal stress. I developed and executed thermal cycling protocols using a hot/cold plate system that integrated a liquid nitrogen (LN2) line for rapid cooling. These tests simulated launch and deep-space temperature fluctuations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Optical performance was observed during thermal cycles by aligning components to a target pattern and monitoring changes in concentric interference fringes. These fringe patterns revealed micrometer-scale shifts in the optical path, allowing us to assess the effects of thermal expansion, bonding integrity, and material mismatch.
  </p>

  <h2>Vacuum Purging and Environmental Qualification</h2>
  <p>
    The hardware was vacuum purged to simulate spaceflight vacuum conditions and ensure the system's resilience to outgassing and pressure differentials. This step was critical in preventing contamination or mechanical stress on bonded optics during launch and operation in Titan’s atmosphere.
  </p>

  <h2>Tooling and Alignment</h2>
  <p>
    I also supported the design of precision tooling and alignment fixtures using SolidWorks and ZEMAX. These fixtures enabled repeatable placement and bonding of optical subsystems, ensuring submillimeter alignment accuracy even after adhesive curing. You can learn more about this under my QAM Encoder Section!

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project helped solidify my understanding of optical-mechanical integration in real-world space hardware. It was also my first time working on hardware with a direct connection to a planetary mission, which deepened my appreciation for rigor, test design, and the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration.
