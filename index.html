  <h2>Selected Work</h2>

  <h3>NASA Dragonfly Mission (Collins Aerospace)</h3>
  <p>
    Used SolidWorks and ZEMAX to design tooling and alignment fixtures for optoelectronic assemblies in support of NASA’s Dragonfly mission. Enabled repeatable subsystem builds using adhesive bonding and tight-tolerance alignment. Evaluated performance under thermal cycling and vibration testing, contributing to spaceflight environmental qualification.
  </p>

  <h3>Optical Encoder Design</h3>
  <p>
    Designed and built a compact optical encoder integrating IR sensors, QAM signal processing, and microcontroller logic to support RTV bond inspection in precision optics systems. Increased detection speed 4× and reduced reliance on commercial solutions.
  </p>

  <h3>Embedded Systems Validation</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a remote test platform using microcontrollers and power analyzers to validate sensing hardware for next-gen aircraft fuel gauging. Led test protocol development across electrical and mechanical failure modes.
  </p>

  <h3>Liquid Hydrogen Sensor Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Managed cryogenic test workflows for 100+ hydrogen sensors. Created structured datasets to track mechanical failure patterns and improve sensor calibration across extreme conditions.
  </p>

  <h3>Cold Atom Laser System (Goodsell Lab, Middlebury College)</h3>
  <p>
    Designed and assembled a 3-laser rubidium cooling system with fiber optic routing and thermal management. Integrated precision alignment tools to support quantum behavior observation under SRPS grant funding.
  </p>

  <h3>Quasar Classification Research (Glikman Lab)</h3>
  <p>
    Analyzed data from 147 quasars using Hubble, GALEX, and WISE. Created SED models and data visualizations to support a publication on red quasar classifications and star formation history.
