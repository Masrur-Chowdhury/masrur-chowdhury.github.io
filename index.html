      <p>
            I am an engineer with a background in physics, systems engineering, and test engineering, passionate about space systems, optics, and solving complex interdisciplinary problems. My experience spans aerospace R&D, quantum optics, and embedded systems development. I value precision, clarity, and innovation in engineering, with a focus on pushing technological boundaries. 
      </p>
      </p>
            I have two years of experience at Raytheon and over three additional years in laboratory research environments. Across all projects, my goal has been consistent: advancing innovation and driving humanity’s progress in science.

  <h2>Selected Work (Click the headings to learn more about the projects!) </h2>


  <h3><a href="Projects/dragonfly.html">NASA Dragonfly Mission: Thermal cycling and fatigue test of optical components (Testing/Validation)</a></h3>

  <p>
    Used SolidWorks and ZEMAX to design tooling and alignment fixtures for optoelectronic assemblies in support of NASA’s Dragonfly mission. Enabled repeatable subsystem builds using adhesive bonding and tight-tolerance alignment. Evaluated performance under thermal cycling and vibration testing, contributing to spaceflight environmental qualification.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="Projects/encoder.html"> Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) Optical Encoder (Testing/ Manufacturing)</a></h3>
  <p>
    Designed and built a compact optical encoder integrating IR sensors, QAM signal processing, and microcontroller logic to support RTV bond inspection in precision optics systems. Increased detection speed 4× and reduced reliance on commercial solutions.
  </p>

  <h3>  <a href="Projects/coldatom.html"> Cold Atom Laser System (Goodsell Lab, Middlebury College)(Testing/Design/Research)</a></h3>
  <p>
    Designed and assembled a 3-laser rubidium cooling system with fiber optic routing and thermal management. Integrated precision alignment tools to support quantum behavior observation under SRPS grant funding.
  </p>

  <h3>Silicon Prier adhesion test (Push and Shear) (Testing/Research)</h3>

 
  <h3>Count-Min Sketch- Randomized Algorithms (Programming)</h3>




  <h3>Embedded Systems Validation (Testing) (Coming soon)</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a remote test platform using microcontrollers and power analyzers to validate sensing hardware for next-gen aircraft fuel gauging. Led test protocol development across electrical and mechanical failure modes.
  </p>


  <h3>Liquid Hydrogen Sensor Testing (Testing) (Coming soon) </h3>
  <p>
    Managed cryogenic test workflows for 100+ hydrogen sensors. Created structured datasets to track mechanical failure patterns and improve sensor calibration across extreme conditions.
  </p>


  <h3>Quasar Classification Research (Glikman Lab) (Research) (Coming soon)</h3>
  <p>
    Analyzed data from 147 quasars using Hubble, GALEX, and WISE. Created SED models and data visualizations to support a publication on red quasar classifications and star formation history.
