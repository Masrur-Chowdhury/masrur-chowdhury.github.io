        Hi! My name is Masrur, pronounced (mus-roor). Welcome to my GitHub page! Here I share the things I have been working on, from engineering projects to film photography. 
      </p>
      
      </p>
        I value precision, clarity, and innovation in engineering, with a focus on pushing technological boundaries. I have an eye for process improvements, advancing manufacturing, and tackling novel technology for rapid integration and experimentation. 
      </p>
      
       <p>
        I graduated from Middlebury College in 2024 with a degree in Physics, where I conducted astrophysics research and led an experimental cold atom project under Middlebury grant funding. I also earned an engineering certificate from UCLA, strengthening my skills in model-based systems engineering and translating my physics and first-principles problem-solving into practical engineering applications.
       </p>

        <p>
        I have two years of experience at Raytheon and over three additional years in laboratory research environments. Across all projects, my goal has been consistent: advancing innovation and driving humanityâ€™s progress in science. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Some of the things I like doing in my free time are taking 35 mm pictures with my Olympus 31 AF, skating/snowboarding, or exploring and finding coffee shops with the perfect table to do work on. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
        Thank you for visiting! You can connect with me via the links in the footer :)

  <h2>Selected Work (Click the headings to learn more about the projects!) </h2>


  <h3><a href="Projects/dragonfly.html">NASA Dragonfly Mission: Thermal cycling and fatigue test of optical components (Testing/Validation)</a></h3>
<!--
  <p>
    Used SolidWorks and ZEMAX to design tooling and alignment fixtures for optoelectronic assemblies in support of NASAâ€™s Dragonfly mission. Enabled repeatable subsystem builds using adhesive bonding and tight-tolerance alignment. Evaluated performance under thermal cycling and vibration testing, contributing to spaceflight environmental qualification.
  </p>
--->

<p><strong>Results/My Impact:</strong></p>
<ul class="project-results">
  <li>Enabled qualification of critical optical assemblies for deep-space deployment.</li>
  <li>Improved optical stability under thermal cycling, reducing alignment drift by ~40%.</li>
  <li>Developed repeatable LNâ‚‚-cooled hot/cold plate protocol adopted for similar spaceflight hardware.</li>
  <li>Identified micrometer-scale bond shift patterns via interference fringe analysis, guiding adhesive selection.</li>
  <li>Shortened environmental test turnaround by 20% through fixture redesign and alignment aids.</li>
  <li>Implemented a direct thermocouple + DMM measurement method to monitor in-chamber optical assembly temperature, eliminating delays from waiting for full chamber cooldown.</li>
</ul>


  <h3><a href="Projects/encoder.html"> Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) Optical Encoder (Testing/ Manufacturing)</a></h3>
  <!--<p>
    Designed and built a compact optical encoder integrating IR sensors, QAM signal processing, and microcontroller logic to support RTV bond inspection in precision optics systems. Increased detection speed 4Ã— and reduced reliance on commercial solutions.
  </p>
  -->
    <p><strong>Results/My Impact:</strong></p>
    <ul class="project-results">
      <li>Reduced RTV bond-pad inspection time by <strong>4Ã—</strong> compared to commercial encoder systems.</li>
      <li>Achieved ~<strong>0.2Â°</strong> angular resolution using dual IR reflective sensors in quadrature.</li>
      <li>Designed and fabricated a custom encoder mount, reflective tape pattern, and alignment fixture for integration with air-bearing spindle.</li>
      <li>Correlated encoder position data with live camera feed via MATLAB + Arduino, enabling calculation of RTV volume around each bond radius.</li>
      <li>Bench-tested system on a precision step stage, verifying movement detection within <strong>Â±1 step</strong> before integration with production hardware.</li>
      <li>Saved an estimated <strong>$10,000+</strong> by replacing a commercial inspection encoder with an in-house solution.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>  <a href="Projects/coldatom.html"> Cold Atom Laser System (Goodsell Lab, Middlebury College)(Testing/Design/Research)</a></h3>
  <p>
    Designed and assembled a 3-laser rubidium cooling system with fiber optic routing and thermal management. Integrated precision alignment tools to support quantum behavior observation under Middlebury grant funding.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="Projects/primertest.html">Silicon Primer adhesion test (Push and Shear) (Testing/Research)</a></h3>
    
  <p><strong>Results/My Impact:</strong></p>
    <ul class="project-results">
    <li>Validated continued manufacturing of large optical assemblies with extended primer sit times beyond the manufacturerâ€™s 24-hour guideline.</li>
    <li>Push and shear testing at 1, 3, 5, 15, 21, 28, and 45 days showed no significant loss in bond strength under controlled conditions.</li>
    <li>Identified humidity as the primary factor in long-term primer performance degradation.</li>
